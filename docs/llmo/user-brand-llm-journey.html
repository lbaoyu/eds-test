    How your content, large language models, and user behavior interact end‑to‑end.
  </p>

  <div class="step-summary">
    <h3>High‑Level Flow</h3>
    <p>The journey we’ll explore:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Brand publishes content on its site (products, docs, support).</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> LLMs crawl and ingest that content as part of their knowledge.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Users ask questions in AI assistants instead of going directly to the site.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> LLMs answer using brand content and sometimes link back to brand pages.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Some users click through, visit the site, and may or may not convert.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each step affects the next. Weakness in any step can show up downstream as
      missing, misleading, or low‑quality AI answers and degraded business outcomes.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- STEP 1 -->

  <h2>Step 1 – Brand Publishes Content on Its Site</h2>
  <p class="section-intro">
    This looks like “business as usual” (publish pages, docs, support articles), but in an
    AI‑assistant world it’s the foundation of everything LLMs can say about your brand.
  </p>

  <h3>1.1 What “publishes content” means in this context</h3>
  <p>
    When we say a brand publishes content, we’re talking about several layers of material, all of
    which can become input to LLMs:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product &amp; marketing content</strong>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Product overview and feature pages</li>
        <li>Pricing, packaging, and plan comparisons</li>
        <li>Use‑case pages and campaign landing pages</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Documentation &amp; technical content</strong>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>User guides and admin guides</li>
        <li>API references and developer docs</li>
        <li>Integration guides, architectures, release notes</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Support &amp; troubleshooting content</strong>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Knowledge base articles and FAQs</li>
        <li>“How do I fix…” guides, known issues, workarounds</li>
        <li>Forum posts and community Q&amp;A</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Educational &amp; thought leadership content</strong>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Tutorials, recipes, templates</li>
        <li>Whitepapers, case studies</li>
        <li>Best‑practice and “how to choose” guides</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    From an LLM’s perspective, all of these are potential <strong>knowledge sources</strong>, each
    tuned to a different type of user question: “What is this?”, “How do I do that?”, “How does X
    compare to Y?”, “What’s wrong and how do I fix it?”.
  </p>

  <h3>1.2 How LLMs “see” your site: structure and semantics</h3>
  <p>
    LLMs rely on underlying systems that crawl, parse, and chunk web pages. These systems benefit
    enormously from <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>semantic clarity</strong>.
  </p>

  <h4>Structural signals</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="inline-heading">Titles and headings:</span> clear, descriptive titles and well‑nested
      headings (<code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>) help identify what each section is about.</li>
    <li><span class="inline-heading">Lists, tables, and steps:</span> bulleted lists for features or
      requirements, numbered lists for procedures, tables for comparisons and parameters.</li>
    <li><span class="inline-heading">Consistent templates:</span> common patterns for product pages, doc pages,
      FAQ pages make it easier to infer where to find definitions, steps, edge cases, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Semantic signals</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="inline-heading">Entity‑rich language:</span> consistent use of brand names, product names,
      feature names, plans, partner names, and core concepts.</li>
    <li><span class="inline-heading">Canonical phrasing:</span> 1–3 sentence definitions reused across key
      pages instead of many slightly different descriptions.</li>
    <li><span class="inline-heading">Intent‑aligned phrasing:</span> content framed around user questions and
      tasks, e.g., “How to set up…”, “How to troubleshoot…”, “Compare X vs Y for scenario Z”.</li>
    <li><span class="inline-heading">Explicit constraints:</span> clear statements of what is <em>not</em>
      supported or recommended, and under what conditions instructions apply.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    The more your content looks like a set of clearly labeled “answerable units”, the easier it is
    for LLM pipelines to ingest it and for assistants to reuse it accurately.
  </div>

  <h3>1.3 Content types that matter most</h3>

  <h4>Canonical reference content</h4>
  <p>
    These define the “official story” for key entities and policies:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>“What is [product]?” definitions</li>
    <li>Capabilities, limits, supported platforms</li>
    <li>Licensing, security, compliance, data handling policies</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These pages heavily influence how models describe your brand and products in definitions and
    comparisons.
  </p>

  <h4>Task and procedure content</h4>
  <p>
    These explain <em>how</em> to do things:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Step‑by‑step how‑to guides</li>
    <li>Configuration flows and setup checklists</li>
    <li>Runbooks and troubleshooting flows</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    LLMs lean on these when users ask “How do I…” or “What should I do next when…”.
  </p>

  <h4>Explain‑and‑compare content</h4>
  <p>
    These put your offerings in context:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Product/plan comparisons</li>
    <li>Pros/cons and trade‑offs between approaches</li>
    <li>“When to use X vs Y” or “How to choose for scenario Z” content</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These strongly influence how AI assistants frame recommendations and competitive positioning.
  </p>

  <h3>1.4 Common pitfalls at Step 1</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ambiguous or inconsistent naming:</strong> multiple names for the same product or feature;
      legacy names left in circulation with no mapping.</li>
    <li><strong>Thin or purely promotional pages:</strong> heavy on slogans, light on actual capabilities,
      constraints, and examples.</li>
    <li><strong>Fragmented answers:</strong> one user question’s answer scattered across many disconnected
      pages with no canonical “home”.</li>
    <li><strong>Outdated content left live:</strong> old instructions and policies not marked as obsolete or
      redirected to newer versions.</li>
    <li><strong>Implicit assumptions:</strong> missing prerequisites and constraints; docs assume background
      knowledge many users don’t have.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.5 GEO‑style best practices for Step 1</h3>
  <p><strong>GEO (Generative AI Engine Optimisation)</strong> at this layer is about making content as usable
    as possible for both humans and LLMs.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Define an intent and entity map:</strong> list top user questions and key entities
      (products, features, concepts) and ensure each has clear, consistent coverage.</li>
    <li><strong>Create canonical answers:</strong> choose one page/section as the authoritative answer for
      each important question and make it robust.</li>
    <li><strong>Standardize structures:</strong> templates for product pages, docs, and support articles with
      predictable sections.</li>
    <li><strong>Make versioning explicit:</strong> mark which product versions content applies to, and flag
      deprecated or legacy material.</li>
    <li><strong>Write in “answerable units”:</strong> each section or FAQ should be able to stand alone as a
      coherent answer to a specific question.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    If you would be uncomfortable with an assistant quoting a section of your site as “the answer”
    to a key question, that section probably needs work before it’s ready for the AI era.
  </div>

  <!-- STEP 2 -->

  <h2>Step 2 – LLMs Crawl and Ingest That Content</h2>
  <p class="section-intro">
    Step 2 is where your web presence becomes part of the LLM ecosystem’s internal knowledge. It
    covers discovery, parsing, chunking, embedding, and indexing.
  </p>

  <h3>2.1 Discovery and crawling</h3>
  <p>
    Before content can influence answers, it has to be found. Discovery typically happens via:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Web crawling infrastructure:</strong> similar to search engines, following links on your site
      and from other sites.</li>
    <li><strong>Sitemaps and feeds:</strong> XML sitemaps and RSS/Atom feeds listing your key URLs.</li>
    <li><strong>Direct submissions or integrations:</strong> in some setups, brands provide URLs or document
      feeds explicitly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Crawlers generally respect <code>robots.txt</code>, <code>noindex</code>, and authentication boundaries.
    Public, crawlable content is what typically makes it into:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Training corpora (for some providers)</li>
    <li>Retrieval indexes used at answer time</li>
    <li>Source pools for citations</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 Parsing and chunking into units of meaning</h3>
  <p>
    Once a page is fetched, it is parsed to separate signal from noise and then split into
    <strong>chunks</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Parsing:</strong> remove boilerplate (navigation, footers, ads), extract main content (titles,
      headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, code).</li>
    <li><strong>Chunking:</strong> break content into smaller, coherent segments—often based on headings or
      FAQ entries—so each chunk can act as a self‑contained answer unit.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Good chunking is easier when your original content is structured and avoids very long,
    multi‑topic, unbroken text.
  </p>

  <h3>2.3 Embeddings and indexes</h3>
  <p>
    Each chunk is then converted into an <strong>embedding</strong>—a high‑dimensional numeric vector that
    captures its meaning. These embeddings are stored in specialized indexes that support semantic
    search.
  </p>
  <p>At answer time, a typical retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) pipeline does this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Convert the user’s question into an embedding.</li>
    <li>Search the index for the most similar chunks (by meaning).</li>
    <li>Pass those chunks to the LLM along with the original question.</li>
    <li>Let the LLM generate a response grounded in those chunks.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Chunks that are focused and clearly labeled are more likely to be retrieved accurately for
    relevant questions.
  </p>

  <h3>2.4 Training vs. retrieval</h3>
  <p>
    Your content can affect LLM behavior via:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Training:</strong>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Content is part of the model’s training corpus.</li>
        <li>Influence is diffuse and mixed with many sources.</li>
        <li>Updates require retraining or fine‑tuning to show up.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Retrieval:</strong>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Content is stored in indexes and retrieved at answer time.</li>
        <li>Influence is more direct and easier to adjust by updating docs.</li>
        <li>Updates can be reflected quickly once the index is refreshed.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Modern assistants rely heavily on retrieval for current, niche, and technical information,
    making your live docs and support content especially important.
  </p>

  <h3>2.5 What determines whether your content is used</h3>
  <p>Not all ingested content is used equally. Key factors include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Authority and reliability:</strong> reputable domains, internally consistent content, and
      alignment with other trusted sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Topical relevance and depth:</strong> clear association between your pages and specific
      intents (“how to do X with Y”, “troubleshoot error Z”).</li>
    <li><strong>Freshness:</strong> up‑to‑date docs and clearly marked versioning; obvious deprecation of
      obsolete material.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical hygiene:</strong> crawlable URLs, parsable HTML, important information in text rather
      than images or hard‑to‑parse widgets.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.6 Common failure modes in ingestion</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Important content not discovered:</strong> missing sitemaps, unlinked pages, or heavy reliance
      on dynamic loading that crawlers can’t traverse.</li>
    <li><strong>Noisy parsing:</strong> key content buried in boilerplate or non‑semantic structures, making
      it hard to isolate important chunks.</li>
    <li><strong>Overlarge or incoherent chunks:</strong> pages that cover many unrelated topics with no clear
      structure, yielding messy retrieval units.</li>
    <li><strong>Conflicting or duplicated content:</strong> multiple pages assert different facts with no
      canonical signal, increasing the risk of mixed or outdated answers.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    Step 2 is about whether AI systems actually “hear” what you say in Step 1. If discovery,
    parsing, or chunking fail, your best content may never meaningfully influence AI answers.
  </div>

  <!-- STEP 3 -->

  <h2>Step 3 – Users Ask Questions in AI Assistants</h2>
  <p class="section-intro">
    In this step, user intent moves from search boxes and site navigation into conversational
    interfaces. The assistant, not your homepage, becomes the default starting point.
  </p>

  <h3>3.1 The behavioral shift</h3>
  <p>
    Traditional path:
    <br />
    <em>User has a need → opens a search engine → scans results → chooses a link → lands on a site.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    New pattern:
    <br />
    <em>User has a need → opens an assistant → asks in natural language → gets a synthesized answer →
      maybe sees links, maybe not.</em>
  </p>
  <p>Key differences:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Less scanning, more trusting:</strong> users see one or a few answers instead of a long list
      of links.</li>
    <li><strong>Richer queries:</strong> users describe context, goals, and constraints rather than just
      keywords.</li>
    <li><strong>Assistant as front door:</strong> the assistant stands between the user and all brands; the
      user may not intentionally search for you at all.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.2 Types of questions users ask assistants</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Exploratory:</strong> “What tools can help me do X?”, “What are options for Y?”</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluative / comparative:</strong> “Compare Product A vs B for scenario Z”, “Is Brand X good
      for regulated industries?”</li>
    <li><strong>Task / how‑to:</strong> “How do I implement X in Product Y?”, “How do I migrate from system A
      to B?”</li>
    <li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> “I see error 1234 when doing this; what should I do?”</li>
    <li><strong>Policy / risk:</strong> “Is this compliant with regulation R?”, “What are security risks if I
      set this up like that?”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Each category taps into different parts of your content and the broader ecosystem (competitor
    docs, reviews, forums).
  </p>

  <h3>3.3 How assistants interpret and expand questions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Intent detection:</strong> classify the question as definition, comparison, how‑to,
      troubleshooting, policy, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Context usage:</strong> use conversation history and any available user context (role, goals,
      environment) to refine interpretation.</li>
    <li><strong>Query expansion:</strong> expand the user’s wording with synonyms, related terms, and
      recognized entities (brands, product categories, technologies).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This allows your brand to be surfaced even if the user never types your name—but also allows
    you to be omitted if your content isn’t strongly associated with relevant contexts.
  </p>

  <h3>3.4 Brand visibility and competition in answers</h3>
  <p>
    Step 3 is where brands compete for <strong>presence inside AI answers</strong>, rather than
    for search ranking positions.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>In a single answer, the assistant may:
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Mention several tools as options.</li>
        <li>Recommend one or two more strongly.</li>
        <li>Explain trade‑offs.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Your brand might:
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Be included as a main option.</li>
        <li>Be mentioned briefly as an alternative.</li>
        <li>Not be mentioned at all.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This is your <em>answer share</em>: how often, and how prominently, you appear in relevant
    assistant answers.
  </p>

  <h3>3.5 Multi‑turn conversation patterns</h3>
  <p>
    Assistant interactions often unfold over multiple turns, for example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>“What tools can I use for X?” → shortlist of tools.</li>
    <li>“Tell me more about option A.” → deeper explanation of a chosen tool.</li>
    <li>“How do I implement this for my specific scenario?” → configuration or how‑to guidance.</li>
    <li>“What are the exact steps, and what should I avoid?” → practical checklist and caveats.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Implications:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you aren’t in the initial shortlist, you are unlikely to appear later.</li>
    <li>If you are selected, the assistant may continue to rely on your content in subsequent turns
      as it guides the user through implementation or troubleshooting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.6 Risks at Step 3</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Invisibility in unbranded queries:</strong> assistant suggests solutions for your category but
      never mentions you.</li>
    <li><strong>Mispositioning:</strong> assistant uses an outdated or incorrect narrative (e.g., “basic” vs
      “enterprise‑ready”, or incorrect industries/segments).</li>
    <li><strong>Over‑generalized recommendations:</strong> assistant suggests your product for cases where
      you’re not a great fit, leading to misaligned expectations.</li>
    <li><strong>Bias toward popular incumbents:</strong> assistants may over‑suggest well‑known brands if
      your content hasn’t clearly and consistently claimed relevant territory.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    Step 3 is where users decide which brands to consider at all. If your content and ecosystem
    signals don’t place you in the right conversations, you never get a chance in later steps.
  </div>

  <!-- STEP 4 -->

  <h2>Step 4 – LLMs Answer Using Brand Content</h2>
  <p class="section-intro">
    At this step, assistants actually respond to users, using a mix of your content, other
    sources, and their internal knowledge. Sometimes they visibly link back to your site;
    other times, they don’t.
  </p>

  <h3>4.1 How an LLM composes an answer</h3>
  <p>
    When answering, an assistant typically:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Understands the question:</strong> identifies intent (define, compare, configure, fix) and
      relevant constraints.</li>
    <li><strong>Retrieves context:</strong> fetches relevant chunks from indexes (which may include your docs,
      support content, and others).</li>
    <li><strong>Generates a response:</strong> synthesizes the information into a coherent answer, optionally
      including steps, examples, warnings, and sometimes citations.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Your content is rarely used in isolation; it is one piece of a broader mosaic of sources.
  </p>

  <h3>4.2 Mixing your content with other sources</h3>
  <p>
    In many real‑world assistants, the model:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fuses multiple sources:</strong> your official docs, competitor docs, independent tutorials,
      reviews, forums, and general knowledge.</li>
    <li><strong>Distills and compresses:</strong> summarizes many pages or chunks into a small answer, leaving
      out details it deems less central.</li>
    <li><strong>Follows system‑level instructions:</strong> internal prompts encourage it to be neutral,
      helpful, and safe, sometimes softening strong marketing language.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If your content is clear, consistent, and fact‑rich, it can anchor the answer. If it is weak,
    outdated, or conflicting, other sources can dominate.
  </p>

  <h3>4.3 Citations and links back to brand pages</h3>
  <p>
    Some assistants expose the sources they used:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Inline citations next to specific statements</li>
    <li>“Sources” blocks listing URLs and snippets</li>
    <li>Expandable sections showing the underlying documents</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Whether your site is shown depends on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If your content was retrieved and considered relevant.</li>
    <li>How many sources the UI chooses to display.</li>
    <li>Whether the answer is treated as “common knowledge” that doesn’t require explicit citation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Importantly, your content can influence the answer even if your URL is not visibly credited in
    the interface.
  </p>

  <h3>4.4 How content affects answer style and stance</h3>
  <p>Your content shapes not just facts, but framing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Definitions and positioning:</strong> consistent, crisp definitions of your products and
      concepts lead to accurate AI descriptions of what you do and who you’re for.</li>
    <li><strong>Strengths and trade‑offs:</strong> honest comparison content informs balanced AI
      recommendations, showing where you’re a good fit and where you aren’t.</li>
    <li><strong>Safety and constraints:</strong> explicit warnings, limits, and “do not do X” language make it
      more likely the AI will include caveats and safe guidance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If your docs are vague or overly “salesy,” the AI may fall back on third‑party narratives and
    generic patterns when describing you.
  </p>

  <h3>4.5 Failure modes and risks in answers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hallucinated capabilities:</strong> the AI says you support features, integrations, or use
      cases you don’t.</li>
    <li><strong>Outdated guidance:</strong> mixed instructions from old and new docs produce procedures that
      used to work but no longer do.</li>
    <li><strong>Incorrect policy/compliance statements:</strong> AI over‑ or under‑states how compliant or
      secure you are, based on confusing or outdated content.</li>
    <li><strong>Shaky troubleshooting:</strong> the AI suggests fixes that only apply in some scenarios, or
      that skip critical diagnostic steps.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These issues can erode trust and create legal or operational risk. They usually trace back to
    gaps or contradictions in available content, plus the LLM’s tendency to generalize.
  </p>

  <h3>4.6 Changing user expectations</h3>
  <p>
    Under classic search, users saw multiple links and judged for themselves. Under AI answers,
    they see one synthesized narrative. That has two big consequences:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Higher perceived authority:</strong> many users treat AI answers as expert summaries that
      integrate “everything important.”</li>
    <li><strong>Less incentive to click:</strong> if the answer feels sufficient, users may not visit any
      underlying site at all.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    Step 4 is where the assistant effectively becomes your spokesperson. The more grounded it is
    in clear, current, official content, the more likely it is to represent you accurately and
    safely.
  </div>

  <!-- STEP 5 -->

  <h2>Step 5 – Users Click Through and May or May Not Convert</h2>
  <p class="section-intro">
    Finally, some users move from the assistant to your site. They bring expectations shaped by
    AI, and their onsite experience determines whether that influence becomes adoption, success, or
    lost potential.
  </p>

  <h3>5.1 Who clicks through (and who doesn’t)</h3>
  <p>From Step 4, users tend to fall into two groups:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Non‑clickers:</strong>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>The AI answer felt “good enough.”</li>
        <li>They don’t seek more detail or official confirmation.</li>
        <li>They may act on the answer without ever visiting your site.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Clickers:</strong>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>They want more detail (full docs, configuration matrices, edge cases).</li>
        <li>They need official confirmation (compliance, security, pricing, legal).</li>
        <li>They need a place to act (sign up, purchase, download, log in, open a ticket).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5.2 What AI‑influenced visitors look like</h3>
  <p>Compared to typical search visitors, AI‑influenced visitors often:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Arrive with a <strong>pre‑formed mental model</strong> of your product and value.</li>
    <li>Are more <strong>task‑driven</strong>, looking for specific details or actions.</li>
    <li>Are less tolerant of high‑level fluff and repeated messaging.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>They expect your site to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm or refine what the assistant told them.</li>
    <li>Provide concrete implementation details, not just restate benefits.</li>
    <li>Help them move forward quickly (sign up, configure, resolve, or learn).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5.3 How their onsite journeys differ</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Deeper entry points:</strong> they often land directly on docs, support articles, or specific
      feature pages instead of your homepage.</li>
    <li><strong>Skipped overviews:</strong> they may skip your high‑level overview content because they feel
      AI already gave them that.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross‑checking AI vs your site:</strong> they may compare AI instructions with your official
      docs; alignment builds trust, misalignment breaks it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5.4 Conversion, partial conversion, and non‑conversion</h3>
  <p>Outcomes for AI‑influenced visitors include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Conversions:</strong>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Trials started, purchases made, demos booked.</li>
        <li>Integrations completed, key features successfully configured.</li>
        <li>Problems resolved without human support.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Partial conversions:</strong>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Better understanding of your product but no immediate action.</li>
        <li>Trials started but not fully onboarded (yet).</li>
        <li>Problems partially mitigated or deferred.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Non‑conversions:</strong>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Users decide you’re not a fit (sometimes a healthy outcome vs misaligned adoption).</li>
        <li>They choose a competitor instead.</li>
        <li>They postpone a decision.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5.5 Support and self‑serve impact</h3>
  <p>AI influences support journeys both before and after users reach your site:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Before arrival:</strong> good AI answers (grounded in your docs) can resolve some issues
      entirely within the assistant, reducing tickets you ever see.</li>
    <li><strong>After arrival:</strong> users may arrive with a likely diagnosis and partial steps from the
      assistant; your content either confirms and completes the fix, or conflicts and amplifies
      confusion.</li>
    <li><strong>Edge cases:</strong> AI helps users articulate unusual scenarios; without long‑tail docs,
      models may guess, leading to brittle or unsafe guidance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5.6 Measuring impact (at a high level)</h3>
  <p>Attribution is imperfect, but there are practical ways to gauge impact:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Direct signals:</strong> clicks from AI citations where referrers or tagged links are visible;
      these can be treated as an “AI / assistant” channel in analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Content‑centric signals:</strong> trends in traffic and outcomes for pages you know are
      frequently surfaced in AI answers (from your own evaluation and testing).</li>
    <li><strong>Survey and qualitative signals:</strong> asking new users or buyers whether AI assistants
      played a role in their research or decision.</li>
    <li><strong>Cohort and lift analysis:</strong> comparing before/after metrics when you improve content
      quality and AI alignment for specific journeys or topics.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    Step 5 is where AI‑shaped intent meets your actual experience. The goal is less about perfect
    attribution and more about ensuring that when AI does send people to you, they can succeed
    quickly and confidently.
  </div>

  <!-- WRAP-UP -->

  <h2>Putting the Five Steps Together</h2>
  <p>
    Across all five steps, you can think of the journey like this:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1 – What you say:</strong> your public content defines what’s even possible for AI to
      learn from you.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2 – Whether AI hears you:</strong> crawling, parsing, and indexing determine how much of
      that content actually enters LLM knowledge and retrieval.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3 – Whether AI brings you into the conversation:</strong> assistants decide if and how
      often to mention and recommend you when users ask questions.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4 – How AI speaks on your behalf:</strong> LLMs blend your content with others to craft
      answers, sometimes citing you, sometimes not.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 5 – What happens when users arrive:</strong> AI‑primed users land on your site with
      expectations; your experience either confirms, deepens, and converts that intent—or loses it.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Taken together, this journey is a practical framework for thinking about how to design,
    maintain, and evolve your content and experiences for an AI‑assistant–centric world.
